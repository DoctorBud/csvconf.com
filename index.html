      <h3><strong><a href ="https://www.metadocencia.org/en/authors/lacion/" target="_blank">Dr. Laura Ación</a></strong></h3>
      <p class="bio">
      I am a Research Scientist at the National Research Council in Argentina (CONICET), where I lead a multidisciplinary artificial intelligence and data science co-laboratory. Our co-laboratory pushes for the responsible use of data, including open science and reproducibility in research, but we also train scientists in these practices. I believe in the transformational power of inclusive collective efforts, that is why I was an instructor and trainer for The Carpentries and co-founded MetaDocencia, a Spanish-speaking organization inspired by the Carpentries that I currently co-direct. I also contributed to catalyze and co-lead other communities of practice such as R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Buenos Aires, R en Buenos Aires, and LatinR, a trilingual Latin American R conference.

      <p class="bio">
      Dr. Alex Hanna is Director of Research at the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR). A sociologist by training, her work centers on the data used in new computational technologies, and the ways in which these data exacerbate racial, gender, and class inequality. She also works in the area of social movements, focusing on the dynamics of anti-racist campus protest in the US and Canada.

      Dr. Hanna has published widely in top-tier venues across the social sciences, including the journals Mobilization, American Behavioral Scientist, and Big Data & Society, and top-tier computer science conferences such as CSCW, FAccT, and NeurIPS. Dr. Hanna serves as a co-chair of Sociologists for Trans Justice, as a Senior Fellow at the Center for Applied Transgender Studies, and sits on the advisory board for the Human Rights Data Analysis Group and the Scholars Council for the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry. FastCompany included Dr. Hanna as part of their 2021 Queer 50, and she has been featured in the Cal Academy of Sciences New Science exhibit, which highlights queer and trans scientists of color. She holds a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics and a BA in Sociology from Purdue University, and an MS and a PhD in Sociology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
