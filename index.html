        <h3>Why CSV?</h3>
        <p>This conference is about all kinds of tools and data - <strong>not</strong> just CSV ones. So why call it <em>CSV</em>,Conf? Because we think CSV embodies certain important qualities that set the tone for the event:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: CSV is incredibly simple - perhaps the simplest structured data format there is</li>
          <li><strong>Openness</strong>: the CSV 'standard' is well-known and open - free for anyone to use</li>
          <li><strong>Easy to use</strong>: CSV can be used from almost every data tool out there from Excel to Hadoop</li>
          <li><strong>Hackable</strong>: CSV is text-based and can be manipulated from a wide range of standard tools</li>
          <li><strong>Big or small</strong>: files range from KBs to TBs and its line-based nature make it perfect for incremental processing</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>`testdat` -- Unit testing for tabular data</h3>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/_inundata"><h4>Karthik Ram</h4></a>
            <div class="bio">Karthik Ram is a co-founder of ROpenSci, and is currently a data science fellow at the University of California's Berkeley Institute for Data Science.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <p>A vast majority of researchers work with tabular data that are most commonly stored as proprietary <code>xls</code> or the more portable <code>csv</code> format. These include data manually entered data, ones derived from sensors, and summary data that were originally <em>"big data"</em>. Such data are typically read into widely used data science tools such as <code>R</code>, <code>Python</code>, or <code>Julia</code> before they can be visualized, manipulated, and analyzed. </p>
<p>One of the biggest stumbling blocks to readily analyzing tabular data is the time and effort it takes to prepare raw data for analysis. These steps often include accounting for missing data, missing dates and <code>NAs</code>, all of which can be introduced accidental or intentional depending on the study design and sampling protocol (<a href="http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/IEE/article/view/4608" title="&quot;Nine simple ways to make it easier to (re)use your data&quot;">White et al 2013</a>). Formatting issues such as the presence of non-ascii and UTF-8 characters can also cause problems when processing csv data. Beyond such initial challenges, data entered manually or caliberation issues with instruments can introduce unintended outliers. Quickly identifying and addressing such issues can safeguard researchers from easily avoidable mistakes (<a href="http://blog.stodden.net/2013/04/19/what-the-reinhart-rogoff-debacle-really-shows-verifying-empirical-results-needs-to-be-routine/" title="&quot;...&quot;">Reinhart and Rogoff Scandal</a>) and improve the overall transparency and quality of research studies. In this talk we present a new R package, <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/testdat/"><code>testdat</code></a>, that provides a suite of functions that allow users to unit test tabular data, much like unit testing for code. Our package allows researchers to write expectations, as one would do with code, and quickly identify cryptic issues, especially when reading large numbers of files. We also describe the major functionality of <code>testdat</code> along with a few use-cases and related tools. </p>

<p>Recycling centers are overcrowded. People get angry and don't sort their waste correctly increasing the amount of what is buried or burned.
Here comes a bunch of hackers, data-scientists and makers dedicated in producing the best open solution ever. From Open Data, they build a predictive model indicating the best time to got to the recycling center. The information is piped to a mobile app that crowdsources where the waste are produced, what recycling center can take care of it and all the alternatives of reuse. And when more precise data is needed, they'll hack a solution to produce it.</p>

            <p>Computers used to be the size of entire rooms. While the hardware has gotten smaller, the space the network occupies has gotten bigger: we're surrounded by hidden infrastructure, from cell towers to fiber lines to networked cameras. For the last few months I've been working on a field guide to seeing that infrastructure, using a mix of sometimes unlikely data sources, including spraypainted street markings for excavation work and DOT permits. This is a talk about finding data in unexpected places, why that data matters, and the value of fieldwork in data-making.</p>

            <h3>Improving access to panel series data for social scientists: the `psData` package</h3>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisgandrud"><h4>Christopher Gandrud</h4></a>
            <div class="bio">Christopher Gandrud is a post-doctoral fellow at the Hertie School of Governance and member of the rOpenGov community working to increase the openness of government and social science data.</div>

            <p>Social scientists have access to many electronically available panel series datasets. However, downloading, cleaning, and merging them together is time-consuming and error-prone: for example, using <a href="http://www.carmenreinhart.com/data/">Reinhart and Rogoff's data</a> on the fiscal costs of the financial crisis involves downloading, cleaning, and merging four Excel files with over 70 individual sheets, one for each countryâ€™s data. Furthermore, because such datasets are not bundled in a format that is easy to manipulate, many of them are not updated on a regular basis.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we introduce the <code>psData</code> package for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R statistical software</a>. This package is being developed under the <a href="https://github.com/rOpenGov/">rOpenGov framework</a> to solve two problems:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Time wasted by social scientists downloading, cleaning, and transforming commonly used data sets for their own research</li>
            <li>Errors introduced by data import and transformation scripts that are written individually and never shared across researchers</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The <code>psData</code> package aims to address these problems by distributing easy to use R functions for downloading, cleaning, and merging datasets used by social scientists. The package focuses on panel series data, which are frequently found in political science and macroeconomics. It is hosted on GitHub and can be easily added to and modified by the community, which will allow to fix and patch distributed datasets to all users simultaneously, improving overall data quality.</p>
            <p>The team behind the rOpenGov/psData project currently includes contributors from universities in five countries, and many will be present in Berlin at the time of the conference.</p>

            <a href="https://twitter.com/thomaslevine"><h4>Thomas Levine</h4></a>
            <div class="bio">Thomas Levine is a dada artist who has recently been doing silly things with lots of spreadsheets.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <p>I see two main issues in the common means of searching across data tables. One issue is that the search is localized to datasets that are published or otherwise managed by a particular entity, and another is that the search mechanism doesnâ€™t use information relating to the tabular structure of these data tables.</p>
            <p>We can do better! Comma search indexes as many data tables as you want, regardless of where theyâ€™re from, and it uses the tabular structure of these data tables to search for them. You provide a spreadsheet as input and receive a list of spreadsheets in return. In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how it works and how to use it.</p>
