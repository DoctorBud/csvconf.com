# What is csv,conf?
csv,conf is a community event for datamakers from all around the world. At csv,conf, we get together to discuss open data, and how data can be used to solve problems across open source, journalism, science, government, and beyond! Over two days, attendees will have the opportunity to learn about ongoing work, share skills, exchange ideas (and stickers!) and kickstart collaborations. The rest of the week will be dedicated to parallel events featuring open data and open scholarship initiatives, communities, and projects. We welcome you to join us for the 8th year! Registration & call for proposals will open soon.
